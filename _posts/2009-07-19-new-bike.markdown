I've been thinking about getting a new bike for a while. But, being the frugal
and practical person that I am (read: cheap) I couldn't really justify buying a
brand new fancy bike when my trusty old trek works just fine. Recently one
evening my rear brake cable broke and I thought to myself “I think this is a
sign, it's about time to look for something new” (I know brake cables are easy
enough to fix, but I really don't need much of an excuse).  I spent most of the
next day at work thinking about what I should look for but on my way home I
passed an old bike on the side of the road for free! What luck!

Well it's not the best bike in the world—an old Schwinn Varsity that weighs
a ton—but I like the way it looks.  Classic, sturdy, yellow...well the yellow
will have to change.  So I have a new project. I'm going to restore the bike.
Replace some of the heavier parts if I can and strip it down and repaint it. Oh
yeah, and get a saddle. In fact I've already started.  I managed to take apart
the thing entirely.  The head tube gave me some grief, but eventually I got
down to just parts. One by one I am cleaning them and sanding them down to get
ready to repaint.  Now if only I can decide on a color.
