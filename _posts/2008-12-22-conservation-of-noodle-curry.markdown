There are many downsides to working in Beaverton and living in Portland.
And that's not to say there's anything wrong with living in Portland.
The problem lies more with the Beaverton side of things. Maybe I'm a
little biased but there isn't much I like about the suburbs. However,
there's one thing that "the Tron" has going for it: hole in the wall
Thai restaurants. There are two equidistant from my office and are
both awesome.

on Canyon and

on Scholls Ferry.

I noticed something about these two places though, one has amazing
Pad Thai but the curries are lacking in punch. While the other has
the best

west of the Willamette but their noodles leave something
to be desired. After pondering it for a while I realized that I can't
remember being at a Thai restaurant where both the noodle dishes and
the curries are equally good. This has led me to the conclusion that
there cannot be a restaurant that makes really good curries and really
good rice noddles. That is to say the noodle curry goodness value
must be conserved:

$$\Delta noodle \Delta curry \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

Does this mean that all hope is lost for couples who can't decide which
Thai place to go to? Perhaps not. I theorize that if two restaurants
combined—but while still utilizing separate kitchens and chefs—they
could in fact achieve the holy grail of Thai cooking physics, a
noodle-curry condensate.
