I was lucky enough this year to have the most awesome experience of attending my
first [Gnomedex](http://www.gnomedex.com/). Gnomedex is the self-described
"Technology Conference of Inspiration and Influence" that meets yearly in
Seattle, WA. It's a bunch of
blogger, new media, tech enthusiast types that get together to discuss the
society and the Internet. It may sound like a bunch of geeks, but this would
only be partially true. Yes there was plenty of talk about gadgets and websites,
but it all came back to community and how technology affects everyone.

Gnomedex is a relatively small conference, usually just a couple hundred people.
Small as it may be, this group of people tends toward the amazing. Even though a
lot people already knew each other through things like
[twitter](http://twitter.com/), getting to meet
in person still is important. After-party conversations ranged from how to build
business models off of twitter to rapid prototyping circuit boards. The one
constant was the quality of the conversation. In the real world, just like on
the web, content is king.

## Good Content

I was most interested in two particular talks at Gnomedex. One by a long time
role-model of mine
[Dr. Phil Plait](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/)&mdash;otherwise
known as the [BadAstronomer](http://twitter.com/BadAstronomer).

Phil gave an awesome talk about skepticism on-line and the misinformation we
are up against. News can spread so fast now that there is practically no
firewall between the public and bad information. His archetypal example was a
particularly bright meteor that was caught on camera, coincidently, a couple of
days after a widely reported collision of two satellites in space. Almost
immediately the Internet (well okay, just twitter) was abuzz with speculation
that the meteor was a piece of the former spacecraft falling to the ground.
Never mind that it happened at the wrong time of day in the wrong location and
was moving far too fast. The rumor that it was a spacecraft quickly became
'fact'.

This misinformation could be avoided if people are careful and ask questions
about the evidence they're presented. Which is his point about skepticism. It's
not really about being cynical or mistrusting but instead simply double checking
the things you hear. Whether it's from wikipedia or from your family doctor,
people can be wrong. And sometimes the wrong info can be dangerous.

Phil has been especially concerned about the growing influence of so called
"antivaxxers". These are people who are using their influence to convince&mdash;likely
because they themselves believe it&mdash;people that vaccines are dangerous and lead
to maladies such as autism. There are thousands of parents who believe this and
it's extremely unfortunate because there is absolutely no link whatsoever! The
real danger lies in not getting kids vaccinated. Suddenly there are cases of
measles and polio and other diseases thought to be more or less eradicated
showing up again in these un-vaccinated children. Some have died. The lesson
here is to fight back. Misinformation is best kept at bay through constant
vigilanceâ€”speaking out on the behalf of truth in letters to news programs,
forum posts, or anywhere else you see questionable content.

Another talk was given the same day by a master of the modern
<acronym title="Do It Yourself">DIY</acronym> movement,
[Bre Pettis](http://www.brepettis.com/). Bre Pettis makes things. He is an
amazing guy who has an uncanny ability
to both consistently come up with great ideas and to follow through on them. He
helped start [NYC resistor](http://www.nycresistor.com/), a group that makes
cool things in New York and is the
founder of [MakerBot](http://makerbot.com/). MakerBot is an awesome open source
3D printer. 3D printers
are great, instead of paper they print things. MakerBot extrudes ABS plastic and
makes it into whatever shape you can imagine. It's like your own mini factory!

Something amazing happed when people were given access to 3D printers. A whole
community sprung up around sharing digital files, just one step from being real
things. One website in particular has emerged, called
[thingverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/).

> "People still haven't figured out that sharing is the best thing ever"<br>
> <span class="pull-right">&ndash;Bre Pettis</span>

Bre talked about the amazing things that can happen when large sets of data are
shared like that. Objects evolve, people add and refine designs and the end
product is almost always better than it started. Historically design has been
such a closed concept, with individuals and companies holding their cards close
to their chest until the final product was unveiled. But it doesn't have to be
this way. Open source is just as strong as ever and wonderful things happen when
people collaborate.

## Showing Up Counts

I didn't realize it until I got back to Portland and had some time to think
about it, but the most interesting thing about all the people at Gnomedex is
they all wanted to be there. I figured that I would be more of a spectator,
happy to watch and maybe learn a thing or two. But really everyone is there to
learn from each other and be a part of something. All you need to do is show up.
I encourage anyone who likes talking about the internet or technology to go to
Gnomedex next year and see who you meet. It's a great conference.
