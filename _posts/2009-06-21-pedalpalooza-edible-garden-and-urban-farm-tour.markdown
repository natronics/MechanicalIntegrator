If you live in Portland and own a bike you've probably heard of
[pedalpalooza](http://www.shift2bikes.org/cal/viewpp2009.php). If not you're
missing out on a two week long event with hundreds of individual rides for all
age groups and types of bikers. From the
[world naked bike ride](http://bikeportland.org/2009/06/14/world-naked-bike-ride-was-it-good-for-you/)
to
[tall bike jousting](http://bikeportland.org/photos/album/72157619959599929/stumptown-joustdown-2009.html)
and quiet rides through the country there is a lot going on. On Saturday I
joined up with the
[permaculture ride](http://www.shift2bikes.org/cal/viewpp2009.php#20-816). I
think it was a big success. About 50 or so people showed up at the first house.
In fact there were so many of us that we decided to break up into smaller groups
because was no way to fit us all in a garden at once.

      The first garden features lots of shady fruit trees. The rest of the yard
      has nice little sections of plants alternating with open space and places
      to sit.

      This house also features a great chicken coop with a nifty little door
      to get to the eggs from the outside.

From there we headed out 20 at a time to the next house. This house is in
Laurelhurst and just 4 years earlier had a standard grass lawn. But the owner
felt inspired to kill every inch of grass and replace it a really nice
permacultured landscape. There are little berms around each planting and rain
barrels (a total of 10!) to collect water for irrigation. She also showed off
her composting toilet system. Given how new the garden is it looks really good.

Next up we visited a pair of urban farming households in NE Portland with
adjoining lots. They seem to share a sense of what a garden should be. Both
have large plantings of edible native plants and share as much as they can with
the community.

The last stop was another house in NE that comes complete with a taste test of
some home made goodies. There were pickles, lavender meade, blackberry wine and
sparkling pear apple cider.

It was a great way to end an afternoon getting inspired to plant more and be
more sustainable. See
