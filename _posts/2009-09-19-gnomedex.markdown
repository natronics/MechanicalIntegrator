Just a quick note, I am going to be at [Gnomedex 9.0](http://www.gnomedex.com/)
this week in Seattle.
Gnomedex is the self-proclaimed "Technology Conference of Inspiration and
Influence!" that attracts some of the leading bloggers and webby types from
around the country. This is my first time attending and I don't really know
what to expect but I hope to have fun! I'm bringing my camera so look for
[pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/natronics) next week, and I might
even post my thoughts here about some of the talks.
