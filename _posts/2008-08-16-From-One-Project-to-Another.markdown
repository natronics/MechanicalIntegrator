# From One Project to Another

<span class="byline">By NATHAN | Published: AUGUST 16, 2008</span>

Over the last 8 months I have found myself busy with a number of interesting
projects and hobbies. One of them has been keeping track of what's new on the
web. In doing so I have noticed what a big deal online identity is. Now I
realize the real value of a blog is not only exchanging information with the
world, but being able to tie back everything you do to one identity. With that
in mind I am starting this blog and trying to keep it updated with some of the
more interesting things that I work on. Or if it's a slow week, maybe just some
opinions on what everyone else is working on.
