I was walking around last night and noticed that 1.) it got dark much earlier
than usual and 2.) it was a bit brisk. Jacket weather even. Finally, fall is
here — or at the very least it's beginning in earnest. Needless to say I am
stoked about this. Fall is probably my favorite season of the year. I never was
a huge fan of summer except for the fact that I didn't have to go to school.
Summer is boring. There I said it. I love hiking and biking and all that, but
day after day it's hot and sunny. Boring. I general I like cold weather. I like
having to bundle up and the chance to show off my cool scarves. But winter tends
to go on too long. Spring is probably the worst. Yeah you get flowers and
gardens, but in mostly all you get is a few warm days to tease you and a whole
bunch of rain.

Fall on the other hand, is the best of both worlds. It's warm during the day and
it's fairly dry, but it has all of the excitement of the coming winter built in.
Nights get cooler, the sweaters come out of the closet. Dark, malty beers flow
and hot tea steams in the mugs of warmth seekers. The trees begin their fiery
year end show as they shut down for the winter. While winter is known for being
gray, fall is awash with

I find the most appealing part of it all is the transition. What's really
interesting about Fall is it's short and right in between two relatively long
seasons. This is why I propose we have new seasons. And not just new names —
like "fwinter" — but somehow really change the weather to be different every 2
months. I want a season with snow, a season with fall leaves, a season where
flowers bloom on trees only, etc. This way life will never be boring.

But instead I just have to enjoy the fall as much as I can and wait out the
winter sitting inside drinking hot chocolate and playing board games. Actually
that doesn't sound so bad.
