This afternoon I came across a lovely collection of
[photos of major cities taken from space](http://www.funtasticus.com/20090810/cities-at-night-from-a-distance/).
I can never get enough of space imagery and I can only
imagine what it must be like to be the person taking these photos. A
friend asked if I had a similar picture of Portland and I knew right where to
look.

[NASA's Johnson Space Center](http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/) maintains
a large database of just about every photograph ever taken by an
astronaut. Most of them are of Earth and you can search by location, date
and even attributes like focal length and cloudiness. For the most part the
really nice ones are picked out and made famous, but they don't have time
to go through all of them. There are some hidden gems buried in the collections
just waiting for someone to
[find](http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/)!

I rotated and brightened this image to make it look better, but if you're
curious the
[original can be found here](/resources/photos/ESC_large_ISS016_ISS016-E-25314.JPG).
