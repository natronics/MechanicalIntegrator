Why to potatoes take so long to cook? Really? I'm hungry now. Potatoes
are so tantalizing. They are tasty, go great with catchup and are super
cheap. But I know that even if I throw them in the oven or a hot pan it's
going to be like eight hours before I can eat anything. This bugs me.
I feel like a true benevolent God would have made potatoes cook a little
faster. Or maybe it's all a test of patience and faith? Oh they
mysteries of life...
