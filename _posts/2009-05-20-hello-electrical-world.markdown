A long time ago I was thinking of getting together enough stuff to
start building my own electrical devices. Somewhere along the way
that idea got derailed. But unlike some of my other hairbrain schemes,
this one really stuck in my head. I kept thinking that eventually I
would get back to it, now it seems that I actually have. Every once
and a while over the last year I would buy a piece of electrical
equipment if I happened across it. It seemed weird at the time because
I didn't have a project in mind or even enough pieces to do anything.
But I knew the eventually it would be useful. Sure enough as of tonight
I have all the pieces to light up an LED!

Funny enough the last thing was just some solder. I had an wires and
plugs laying around, and even a nice bench power supply. But no way to
connect them together. So once I had power and wires I hooked up a
pirated LED from a cheap light up wand (often sold to kids at carnivals).
And there you have it: a simple circuit. Welcome to the exciting world
of electricity!
