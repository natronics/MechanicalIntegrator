Every once and a while I feel crafty. I think this is a perfectly normal thing
to feel and I enjoy stretching the brain a little and getting down with some hot
glue and scissors. Or maybe even thread and felt. You never know. Once I made a
tiny diorama inside a match box at a craft party.

So I was talking to my friend Adam this afternoon about how 8:30 am
[Scanning Electron Microscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope)
classes are way to early when he told me I should check out
[cubecraft](http://www.cubeecraft.com/). CubeCraft has a bunch of downloadable
templates for making cute little figures out of paper. So I decided to make a
[Bender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_%28Futurama%29). Here is how it went
together:

I started out by
[printing out the little guy](http://www.cubeecraft.com/characters/character027.jpg).
Then I cut out all the pieces and started folding.

Actually he turned out looking pretty cool. So cool that I also had to
[make a Zoidburg](http://www.cubeecraft.com/characters/character014.jpg)
too:

In doing this I came across a bunch of other paper craft sites that had little
characters to make. This is what I like about the internet. One little push in
the right direction and you can fly down a hill in a whole new genre you never
even knew existed before. I am looking forward to perusing more fun little things
like this, and who knows I might even design some of my own. Also I'm thinking
this is a great idea for a get together. Anyone want to do a paper craft party?
