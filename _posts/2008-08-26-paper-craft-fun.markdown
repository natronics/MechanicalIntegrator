Every once and a while I feel crafty. I think this is a perfectly normal thing
to feel and I enjoy stretching the brain a little and getting down with some hot
glue and scissors. Or maybe even thread and felt. You never know. Once I made a
tiny diorama inside a match box at a craft party.

[Scanning Electron Microscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope)

Then I cut out all the pieces and started folding.
